🎮 Gameniverse: A Mini Arcade Built with Amazon Q CLI

Ever dreamed of launching multiple retro-style games from one place — like a tiny arcade universe?

Meet Gameniverse: A modular, Pygame-powered game launcher where you can jump into classics like Super Mario, Flappy Bird, and Snake, all from a single UI.
And the wildest part? It was built entirely using prompts — no hand-written code.

✨ Powered by Amazon Q CLI, this project:

Generated clean, modular game code

Structured the entire project

Debugged in real-time — all through natural language

🕹️ Games Included:

Super Mario (Pygame platformer)

Snake (Nokia-style nostalgia)
